A method in java is a group of statements to carry out some operation also known as functions. 
Method is declared inside a class with method name followed by parentheses ( ). A method executes only when it is called.

We have some predefined methods in java such as sqrt(), pow() System.out.println() etc,. Meanwhile we can also create our own method. Below is syntax and example of a method.

Syntax:

modifier returnType methodName(Parameter List) 
{
   // method body
}


In the above java method syntax,

“public” is an access modifier. By declaring public a method can be accessed everywhere.
“int” is return type to return some value. If it is void, it does not return any value.
“addTwoNumbers” is method name. As per naming convention a method name should start with a lowercase and if method name is more than a word then every word starting should be of uppercase.
method body should be enclosed between two curly ({ }) braces.
addTwoNumbers() method has two parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’. They can be left empty.
