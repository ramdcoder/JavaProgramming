Unary operators in java

[Unary operators in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/unary-operators-in-java-with-example/)

Unary operator needs only one operand to increment, decrement, etc. Here are various unary operators,

Logical complement operator (!): reverses logical state or value of operand. If the value is false, it converts value to true and vice versa.
Unary minus (-): converts positive value to negative value.
Increment (++): increments value of an integer. post and pre-increment.
Decrement (- -): decrements value of an integer. post and pre-decrement.
Unary plus (+): operator represents positive value. That is it makes all bits inverted, every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0.

Here’s an example on ‘NOT’ (!) operator.

public class JavaUnaryOperator
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      boolean bool = true;
      int a = 14, b = 5;
      System.out.println("Before using NOT operator(!): " + bool);
      System.out.println("a = " + a);
      System.out.println("b = " + b);
      System.out.println("After using using NOT operator(!): " + !bool);
      System.out.println("!(a < b) = " + !(a < b));
      System.out.println("!(a > b) = " + !(a > b));
   }
}
