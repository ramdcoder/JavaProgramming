Assignment operators are used to assign some value to variable. It’s a combination of left and right hand side operand.

Let’s see an example,

public class AssignmentOperatorDemo 
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
      int num;
      String strName;
      num = 16;
      strName = "flowerbrackets";
      System.out.println(num);
      System.out.println(strName);
   }
}
