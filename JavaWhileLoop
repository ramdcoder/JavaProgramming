# While loop in java

A java while iterates a block of statements until a condition is true. In a while loop condition is executed first.

If a condition is true then statements inside while loop is executed. Else program control passes out of the loop.

Looping statements in java are used to execute some block of statements until some expression or condition is evaluated.

**Syntax:**

```
while(condition)
{
   // code goes here
}
```

**while loop in java example:**

```
public class WhileLoopDemo
{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      int a = 1;
      while(a < 10)
      {
         System.out.println(a);
         a++;
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}
