Sparse matrix and its representations in java

Sparse matrix is a two dimensional array also known as a sparse array. In this matrix majority of elements are zero and very few are non zero elements.

For example, consider two rows and three columns matrix. In this matrix there are only two values and the remaining are blank. This vacant place are filled with zero.

Why we are using sparse matrix?

Sparse matrix reduces the scanning time and how exactly it reduces the scanning time is, if there is m x n matrix where m = 50 and n is also = 50.

This means, for searching all the elements we require 2500 times scanning to find the value.

So instead of scanning 2500 times you can use a sparse matrix. In sparse matrix you can directly get the values that exists in the matrix.
