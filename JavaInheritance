Inheritance in java

[Inheritance in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/inheritance-in-java/)

Inheritance is a procedure of acquiring all the properties and behaviour of a parent class (super class) into child class (subclass).

Inheritance represents “IS-A” relationship between super class and subclass. By inheriting we are reusing all the methods, properties and behavior of super class.

Syntax:

class SubClass extends SuperClass
{
   // variables and methods
}

A class in java can be extended by creating new class which can retain the characteristics of the super class or parent class. 
Keyword “extends” means increasing the functionality of parent class or super class.

Let’s see example for inheritance in java.

// inheritance in java example
// super class
class Animal
{
   void eat()
   {
      System.out.println("Animal is eating.");
   }
}
// subclass
class Lion extends Animal
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Lion obj = new Lion();
      obj.eat();
   }
}
