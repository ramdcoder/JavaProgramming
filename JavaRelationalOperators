Relational operators in java

[Relational operators in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/relational-operators-in-java/)

Relational operators are used to compare two operands or variables for equality, greater than, less than etc., and return boolean output. There are six relational operators,

Equals to operator (==)
Less than operator (<)
Greater than operator (>)
Not equals to operator (!=)
Greater than equals to operator (>=)
Less than equal to operator (<=)

Letâ€™s see an example for equals to (==) relational operator in java.

public class RelationalOperatorExample
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
      int a = 7;
      double d = 262.0001;
      char c = 'm';
      // comparing character to character
      System.out.println(c == c);
      // comparing character to integer
      System.out.println(c == a);
      // comparing ASCII value to integer
      System.out.println(71 == a);
      // comparing integer to double
      System.out.println(a == d);
      // comparing integer to integer
      System.out.println(a == a);
   }
}


Output:

true
false
false
false
true
