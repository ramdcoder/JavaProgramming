Simple

Java is concise, easy to write, understand and learn. Java is designed based on C++ so that programmers could learn it easily. 
It eliminates several language features available in C and C++.

For example â€“ java has removed go-to statements, header files structures, operator overloading and pointers.

Secure

There is no explicit pointer in java. It provides secure way to access web applications and secure means of creating Internet application.

Java is designed to be secure in a networked environment. Classloader a part of JRE loads classes into JVM dynamically.

Classloader separates package for classes of local file from imported network sources, thereby adding security.

It uses bytecode verification to ensure that code loaded over the network does not violate java security constraints.
