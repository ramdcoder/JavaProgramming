Multiple inheritance in java

[Multiple inheritance in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/multiple-inheritance-in-java/)

Multiple inheritance is one of the object oriented feature where a class or a sub class can inherit features from more than one parent class or super class.

Letâ€™s see why java does not support multiple inheritance in java with an example.

class X
{
   void print()
   {
   }
}
class Y
{
   void print()
   {
   }
}
class Z extends X, Y
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Z obj = new Z();
      obj.print()
   }
}
