Getter and Setter in java

[Getter and Setter in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/getter-and-setter-in-java/)

Get and set methods are basically used in Encapsulation. Encapsulation means hiding sensitive date from user. 
To hide sensitive data from user we have to declare class variables as private.

For example:

public class Student
{
   private String name;
   // getter method
   public String getName()
   {
      return name;
   }
   // setter method
   public void setName(String stuName)
   {
      this.name = stuName;
   }
}
