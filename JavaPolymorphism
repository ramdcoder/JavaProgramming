Polymorphism in java

[Polymorphism in java](https://www.flowerbrackets.com/polymorphism-in-java/)

Polymorphism literally means many forms. Polymorphism is the ability of a method to perform different tasks. 
It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

For example: Wood has many forms table, chair, dinning table etc.

Polymorphism in java example

class Shapes
{
   public void sides()
   {
      System.out.println("A shape can have many sides.");
   }
}
class Square extends Shapes
{
   public void sides()
   {
      System.out.println("square has four sides.");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shapes
{
   public void sides()
   {
      System.out.println("triangle has three sides.");
   }
}
class PolymorphismExample
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Square obj1 = new Square();
      obj1.sides();
      Triangle obj2 = new Triangle();
      obj2.sides();
   }
}


Output:

square has four sides.
triangle has three sides.
