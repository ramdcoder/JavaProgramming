Letâ€™s see an example on difference between while and do while in java.

int a = 20;
while(a < 5)  // here condition executes false
{
   System.out.println("hello world");
   a++;
}

---------------------------------------------------------

// do-while loop
int a = 20;
do{
   System.out.println("hello world");
   a++;
}while(a < 5);  // here condition executes false
